Figure 1 shows the original signal i.e., the noisy signal which is chosen by the sin of Auxiliary channel TU1 U(V)
Auxiliary channel TU1 U(V) id the volume of charges that is present in that battery at any instance of charging and discharging redorded at Real-time/Relative time and Absolute Time

Figure 2 shows the Low pass filtering accomplished on the noisy signal

Figue 3 is to clearly show the low pass filtered signal which is free from noise. 
It is the same Auxiliary channel TU1 U(V) signal which was noisy in Figure 1 and which is then clean in Figure 2 by the acion of Low Pass Band filtering
